# ORM

Based on your previous `SQL` homework, you have to reproduce a db_schema of entities and all queries using `SQLAlchemy`.

## Exercises

### 1. Install [SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) and [pymysql](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/).

### 2. In `main.py` file you need to update a connection string to db with your values and that is all you need for start. 

## Output:

You have implemented all entities and queries. The console output should be simular to the output you got in `SQL` homework.
Take a screenshot of a console output.
