# Slicing

## Exercises

###1. Slicing strings.

Using python string `s = "a0-b1-c2-d3-e4-f5-g6"` use slicing technic to get strings specified in the comments.
Open basic_types for slices that you need to get.

###2. Integer sum.

Given two numbers represented as a string calculate their sum and store it in the 'result' variable as a string.

#### Example:

integer_number_one = "1"
integer_number_two = "2"
...your code does it's magic

print(result)
>> "3"

###3. Binary sum.
In the 'basic_types.py' there is are to binary numbers defined:  
- binary_number_one
- binary_number_two
They are represented in the string form. Your challenge is to write a code that will calculate the sum of those binary numbers and store it as a variable called 'result' in a binary string form.  

#### Example:

number_one = "0101"
number_two = "11"
...your code does it's magic
print(result)
>> "1000"

Write your code in `basic_types.py` file.
