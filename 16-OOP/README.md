# OOP

Design and create classes for the simplified version of online books shop.
Place your code into `books.py`

## Exercises

The workflow should look like the following:

1. Create a store.
2. Create books in the store.
3. Create new user.
4. Add a couple of the books to the user cart.
5. Create an order from the user cart.
6. Print details of that order.

More details to help shape the domain model:

- Every user has an account on the site. Account contains basic information about a user: name, surname, date of birth, email, phone.
- Every user has a list of previous orders.
- Every order contains list of ordered books, total amount, delivery address.
- Book has a title, number of pages, the year of publishing, and an information about an author.
- Books can be grouped into series. For example, Harry Potter.
- User can add books into cart, before ordering them.
