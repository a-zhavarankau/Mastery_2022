# Logging task

In this task you will need to configure a logging handler and add missing logging statements.  

## Exercises

### 1. Custom logger  
First start by defining a logger that will write logging messages into 'log.txt' file. The format of the message should be the following:
   '2021-07-08 16:49:45,896 - logging_task - DEBUG - debug message', where
   'simple_example' - is the name of the module in which logging handler was called,
   'DEBUG' - level of the logging message,
   'debug message' - debug message.  
  

### 2. Place correct logger.  
After that use your logger to fill the blank spaces in the 'very_important_task' function. In place of each comment add a call to your logger. Run the resulting code. Add 'log.txt' file into git and commit.
