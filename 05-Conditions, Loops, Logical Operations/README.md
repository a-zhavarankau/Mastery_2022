# Conditions, Loops, Logical Operations

## Exercises

### 1. Print 'Won!'
Change the variables `a` and `b` in a such a way, that when you run you code you will see only one word `WON!` printed in the console. After that refactor this code to use 'truthy' values and not direct comparison with bool literals.
### 2. Stop the loop 
Implement the body of the loop in such way, that the `count` variable will have the value of 12 in the end.
### 3. Hello world  
Write a code that iterates over integers starting from 0 till 100. 
On each iteration do the following checks: 
- If number is multiple (could be divided without remainder) of 3 then print the word "Hello" and that number into the console. 
- If the number is multiple of 5 then print the word "world" and that number into the console.
- If the number is multiple of both 3 and 5 print the phrase "Hello world" and that number into the console.  
- If the number is not multiple of 3 or 5 donâ€™t print anything.  

#### Examples:

```(Python)
> current_number = 3  
> \>> Hello 3 
> current_number = 5  
> \>> world 5 
> current_number = 15  
> \>> Hello world 15
```

### 4. Array of duplicates
Imagine that you are given an array of numbers. Each number is repeated twice except one. For example `[2, 2, 3, 1, 3]` non repeating number is one. Write a code to find this non-repeating number.
